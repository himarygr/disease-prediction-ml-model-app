# Disease Prediction ML Model App
This repository contains a machine learning model integrated into a Streamlit web application. The model predicts diseases based on input symptoms and provides treatment recommendations.

## Files and Directories:
* symptom_precaution.csv: Dataset containing symptom-precaution pairs.
* symptom_Description.csv: Dataset containing symptom descriptions.
* model.cbm: Trained machine learning model.
* model_learning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for model training.
* dataset_diseases.csv: Dataset with information on diseases.
* app.py: Main application file using Streamlit.
* ai_assistent.jpeg: Image file.
* catboost_info: Directory containing model information.

## Usage:
Install the necessary dependencies by running $ pip install -r requirements.txt $.
Run the application using $ streamlit run app.py $.
Open the application in your web browser.

## How It Works:
The application takes input symptoms from the user.
The machine learning model processes the symptoms and predicts potential diseases.
Recommendations for treatment are provided based on the predicted disease.
